Sports Application - Before You Install

This installer will copy the Sports Application files to your computer. It will create a Start Menu entry and a desktop shortcut so you can easily launch the program. The installer may also create or update folders under Program Files.

This "before" information file is important because it tells the user what will happen during installation and gives them a chance to cancel if they are not comfortable with the changes that will be made.
